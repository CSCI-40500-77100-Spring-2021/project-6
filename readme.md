# Maven

### Maven is a decentralized library where people can come to search up textbooks to trade or rent. We will have an initial collection of popular textbooks at first to garner users, who can then expand the collection of available books (receiving commission for doing so), or request to rent a book that they need.

### To run, clone the repo and open the homepage(index.html) with any web browser.
